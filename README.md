All the program can be compiled using Makefile with command "make all"

P11.c -> Finds the Optimal BST by reading in the contents of a file and creating a root table for every word. 
Once the root table is created, dynammic programming approach is used to find a Optimal BST. Once the tree 
has been successfully created, program asks the user to enter a search key. The program goes throught the 
BST created to find the key entered. If the result is found, the result is printed and if result does not
match, then user is informed that node could not be found in the tree. 

P12.c -> Finds the Optimal BST by reading in the contents of a file and creating a tree using the Greedy method.
The key with the highest frequency is made the root node. Then the program runs in a recursive way to find the 
root of the subtree in the similar way and hence create a BST. Once the tree has been successfully created, 
program asks the user to enter a search key. The program goes throught the BST created to find the key entered. 
If the result is found, the result is printed and if result does notmatch, then user is informed that node could 
not be found in the tree.

P21.c -> Solves the stable marriage problem by taking is input as the prefernce of males and females as matrix 
respectively. The programs asks the user to enter a file to read from. Program can run with either a 3x3 or 4x4 
Matrix. The program prints the final outcome to the screen in the matrix form once calculated. In the output Matrix
rows represent the males and the columns represent the females.
